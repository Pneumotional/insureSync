## Overview
This system manages non-life insurance policies with a focus on motor insurance and financial management. The platform is built using Django and incorporates several apps to handle policies, customers, intermediaries, endorsements, commissions, claims, and more.

---

## System Architecture
The system follows a modular design, using Django's app structure. Each app serves a specific function:
- **App for Motor Policies:** Manages motor-related insurance policies.
- **App for Customers:** Manages customer profiles and details.
- **App for Intermediaries/Agents:** Handles agent relationships and commissions.
- **App for Endorsements:** Manages policy amendments such as changes or cancellations.
- **App for Commissions:** Tracks commissions due to intermediaries or agents.
- **App for Claims:** Manages insurance claims processing.
- **App for Setups:** Manages system configurations including product setups, risk types, and endorsement types.
- **App for Reports:** Generates various financial and operational reports.
- **App for Employees:** Manages employee profiles and permissions.
- **App for Receipts & Payments:** Handles the financial transactions and record-keeping.

---

## User Roles & Permissions
### Roles:
- **Admin:** Full access to all apps and functionalities.
- **Underwriter:** Access to motor policies, endorsements, and claims.
- **Agent:** Limited access to customer profiles and commissions.
- **Customer Support:** Access to customer profiles and claims only.

### Permissions:
- Each user role has specific access to data and actions. Permissions are controlled at the app level and define whether users can view, edit, or delete records.

---

## App Structure
Each app follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.

   - Views: Customer profile management, customer search
   - Controllers: API for customer creation, update, and queries
3. **Intermediaries/Agents**

## Process Flow

### Motor Policies
1. **Policy Creation:**  
   The user (e.g., underwriter) creates a new motor policy by inputting details such as vehicle information, coverage type, and premium amount.
   
2. **Policy Renewal:**  
   A policy nearing expiration can be renewed by selecting the policy and updating the effective dates and terms.

3. **Policy Amendment (Endorsements):**  
   Endorsements can be added to update coverage, change the policyholder's details, or cancel the policy.

### Customers
1. **Customer Registration:**  
   Customer details, including personal information, contact, and address, are entered into the system.
   
2. **Customer Search:**  
   Customer profiles can be retrieved via search filters based on name, policy number, or vehicle registration.

### Intermediaries/Agents
1. **Agent Assignment:**  
   Agents are assigned to specific customers or policies and are linked to commission rates.
   
2. **Commission Calculation:**  
   Commissions are calculated based on policy premiums and commission rates.

### Endorsements
1. **Endorsement Types:**  
   Users can create different types of endorsements, including coverage changes or policy cancellations.
   
2. **Endorsement Workflow:**  
   Each endorsement follows an approval workflow before being applied to the policy.

### Commissions
1. **Commission Tracking:**  
   Commissions are tracked for each agent based on the premium of the policies they handle.
   
2. **Commission Payouts:**  
   Payout schedules are generated periodically, detailing the commissions owed to each agent.

### Claims
1. **Claims Registration:**  
   Users (e.g., customer support) register claims against a policy, detailing the incident and estimated loss.
   
2. **Claims Processing:**  
   Claims go through a series of steps, including validation, approval, and settlement.

### Setups
1. **Product Setup:**  
   Admins can define new insurance products, assign them to product groups, and specify their characteristics.
   
2. **Risk Setup:**  
   New risk types and labels can be added to classify policies by risk.

### Reports
1. **Report Generation:**  
   Reports such as policy statements, outstanding debits, and renewal notices are generated for internal and external use.
   
2. **Exporting Reports:**  
   Reports can be exported in various formats (e.g., PDF, CSV).

### Employees
1. **Employee Management:**  
   Admins can add new employees, assign roles, and manage their permissions.
   
2. **Role Assignment:**  
   Each employee is assigned a role that dictates their access to the system's apps.

### Receipts & Payments
1. **Payment Processing:**  
   Payments made by customers for policy premiums are recorded in the system.
   
2. **Receipts Management:**  
   Receipts for payments are generated and can be printed or emailed to customers.

## Data Models
Define the data structure for each app, specifying the fields and relationships between models.

---

## API Endpoints
List the available API endpoints for interacting with each app, including authentication requirements and data input/output formats.

---

## Security Considerations
- Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users can only access authorized data.
- HTTPS encryption for secure data transmission.
- Audit trails for tracking changes to policies, endorsements, and claims.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for additional non-life insurance products.
- Implement customer self-service features, allowing customers to view policies and file claims online.
